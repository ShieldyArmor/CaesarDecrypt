# CeaserDecrypt

Why has noone edited this yet? Nevermind, I'll do it myself.

This is a simple website where you can type in a word or sentence and have the website encrypt it by shifting the alphabet.
Simply type anything into the encryption box and how many letters you want to shift, and you're good to go. It also includes some references to Alan Turing.

That's it for now, actually. Will update this accordingly in the future.
